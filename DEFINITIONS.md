# Definitions

## Introduction

**Background (#325)**<br>
This entry usually highlights major historic events and current issues and may include a statement about one or two key future trends.

## Geography

**Location (#276)**<br>
This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.

**Geographic coordinates (#277)**<br>
This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the centroid or center point of a country expressed in degrees and minutes; it is based on the locations provided in the Geographic Names Server (GNS), maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency on behalf of the US Board on Geographic Names.

**Map references (#278)**<br>
This entry includes the name of the <em>Factbook</em> reference map on which a country may be found. Note that boundary representations on these maps are not necessarily authoritative. The entry on <b>Geographic coordinates</b> may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.

**Area (#279)**<br>
This entry includes three subfields. <em>Total area</em> is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. <em>Land area</em> is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). <em>Water area</em> is the sum of the surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines.

**Area - comparative (#280)**<br>
This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

**Land boundaries (#281)**<br>
This entry contains the <em>total</em> length of all land boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous <em>border countries</em>. When available, official lengths published by national statistical agencies are used. Because surveying methods may differ, country border lengths reported by contiguous countries may differ.

**Coastline (#282)**<br>
This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area (including islands) and the sea.

**Maritime claims (#283)**<br>
This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which are excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive descriptions:<br /> <br /><em>territorial sea</em> - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea, described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the mean low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal state; where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither state is entitled to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baseline from which the territorial seas of both states are measured; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic states.<br /> <br /><em>contiguous zone</em> - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a zone contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it may exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the above laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea; the contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (e.g., the US has claimed a 12-nautical mile contiguous zone in addition to its 12-nautical mile territorial sea); where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither state is entitled to extend its contiguous zone beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baseline from which the contiguous zone of both states are measured.<br /> <br /><em>exclusive economic zone (EEZ)</em> - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ as a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents, and winds; jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.<br /> <br /><em>continental shelf</em> - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and consists of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; wherever the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline, coastal states may extend their claim to a distance not to exceed 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500-meter isobath, which is a line connecting points of 2,500 meters in depth; it does not include the deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.<br /> <br /><em>exclusive fishing zone</em> - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS, some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an EEZ but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off their coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often used; the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or 200 nautical miles.

**Climate (#284)**<br>
This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes throughout the year; in the World entry only, it includes four subfields that describe climate extremes:<br /><br /><em>ten driest places on earth (average annual precipitation)</em> describes the annual average precipitation measured in both millimeters and inches for selected countries with climate extremes.
<p><em>ten wettest places on earth (average annual precipitation)</em> describes the annual average precipitation measured in both millimeters and inches for selected countries with climate extremes.</p>
<p><em>ten coldest places on earth (lowest average monthly temperature)</em> describes temperature measured in both degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit as well as the month of the year for selected countries with climate extremes.</p>
<p><em>ten hottest places on earth (highest average monthly temperature)</em> describes the temperature measured both in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit as well the month of the year for selected countries with climate extremes.</p>

**Terrain (#285)**<br>
This entry contains a brief description of the topography.

**Natural resources (#287)**<br>
This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance, such as rare earth elements (REEs). In general, products appear only if they make a significant contribution to the economy, or are likely to do so in the future.

**Land use (#288)**<br>
This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three different types of land use: <em>agricultural land, forest, and other</em>; <em>agricultural land</em> is further divided into <em>arable land</em> - land cultivated for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest, <em>permanent crops</em> - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest, and includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, and <em>permanent pastures</em> and meadows &ndash; land used for at least five years or more to grow herbaceous forage, either cultivated or growing naturally; <em>forest</em> area is land spanning more than 0.5 hectare with trees higher than five meters and a canopy cover of more than 10% to include windbreaks, shelterbelts, and corridors of trees greater than 0.5 hectare and at least 20 m wide; land classified as <em>other</em> includes built-up areas, roads and other transportation features, barren land, or wasteland.

**Irrigated land (#289)**<br>
This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is artificially supplied with water.

**Natural hazards (#292)**<br>
This entry lists potential natural disasters. For countries where volcanic activity is common, a <em>volcanism</em> subfield highlights historically active volcanoes.

**Geography - note (#295)**<br>
This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of significance not included elsewhere.

**Population distribution (#348)**<br>
This entry provides a summary description of the population dispersion within a country. While it may suggest population density, it does not provide density figures.

**Elevation (#407)**<br>
This entry includes the <em>mean elevation</em> and elevation extremes, <em>lowest point</em> and <em>highest point.</em>

## People and Society

**Population (#335)**<br>
This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993 <em>Factbook</em>, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

**Nationality (#336)**<br>
This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - <em>noun</em> and <em>adjective</em>.

**Demographic profile (#340)**<br>
This entry describes a country’s key demographic features and trends and how they vary among regional, ethnic, and socioeconomic sub-populations. Some of the topics addressed are population age structure, fertility, health, mortality, poverty, education, and migration.

**Age structure (#341)**<br>
This entry provides the distribution of the population according to age. Information is included by sex and age group as follows: <em>0-14 years (children)</em>, <em>15-24 years (early working age)</em>, <em>25-54 years (prime working age)</em>, <em>55-64 years (mature working age)</em>, <em>65 years and over (elderly)</em>. The age structure of a population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead to unrest.

**Dependency ratios (#342)**<br>
Dependency ratios are a measure of the age structure of a population. They relate the number of individuals that are likely to be economically "dependent" on the support of others. Dependency ratios contrast the ratio of youths (ages 0-14) and the elderly (ages 65+) to the number of those in the working-age group (ages 15-64). Changes in the dependency ratio provide an indication of potential social support requirements resulting from changes in population age structures. As fertility levels decline, the dependency ratio initially falls because the proportion of youths decreases while the proportion of the population of working age increases. As fertility levels continue to decline, dependency ratios eventually increase because the proportion of the population of working age starts to decline and the proportion of elderly persons continues to increase.<br /><br /><em>total dependency ratio</em> - The total dependency ratio is the ratio of combined youth population (ages 0-14) and elderly population (ages 65+) per 100 people of working age (ages 15-64). A high total dependency ratio indicates that the working-age population and the overall economy face a greater burden to support and provide social services for youth and elderly persons, who are often economically dependent.<br /><br /><em>youth dependency ratio</em> - The youth dependency ratio is the ratio of the youth population (ages 0-14) per 100 people of working age (ages 15-64). A high youth dependency ratio indicates that a greater investment needs to be made in schooling and other services for children.<br /><br /><em>elderly dependency ratio</em> - The elderly dependency ratio is the ratio of the elderly population (ages 65+) per 100 people of working age (ages 15-64). Increases in the elderly dependency ratio put added pressure on governments to fund pensions and healthcare.<br /><br /><em>potential support ratio</em> - The potential support ratio is the number of working-age people (ages 15-64) per one elderly person (ages 65+). As a population ages, the potential support ratio tends to fall, meaning there are fewer potential workers to support the elderly.

**Median age (#343)**<br>
This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in Niger and Uganda to 40 or more in several European countries and Japan. See the entry for "Age structure" for the importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by implication, a low versus a higher median age.

**Population growth rate (#344)**<br>
The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.

**Birth rate (#345)**<br>
This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

**Death rate (#346)**<br>
This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.

**Net migration rate (#347)**<br>
This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall level of population change. The net migration rate does not distinguish between economic migrants, refugees, and other types of migrants nor does it distinguish between lawful migrants and undocumented migrants.

**Population distribution (#348)**<br>
This entry provides a summary description of the population dispersion within a country. While it may suggest population density, it does not provide density figures.

**Urbanization (#349)**<br>
This entry provides two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, <em> urban population</em>, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country. The second, <em>rate of urbanization</em>, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time. It is possible for a country with a 100% urban population to still display a change in the rate of urbanization (up or down). For example, a population of 100,000 that is 100% urban can change in size to 110,000 or 90,000 but remain 100% urban.<br /><br />Additionally, the World entry includes a list of the <em>ten largest urban agglomerations</em>. An <em>urban agglomeration</em> is defined as comprising the city or town proper and also the suburban fringe or thickly settled territory lying outside of, but adjacent to, the boundaries of the city.

**Major urban areas - population (#350)**<br>
This entry provides the population of the capital and up to six major cities defined as urban agglomerations with populations of at least 750,000 people. An <em>urban agglomeration</em> is defined as comprising the city or town proper and also the suburban fringe or thickly settled territory lying outside of, but adjacent to, the boundaries of the city. For smaller countries, lacking urban centers of 750,000 or more, only the population of the capital is presented.

**Sex ratio (#351)**<br>
This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age groups - <em>at birth</em>, <em>under 15 years</em>, <em>15-64 years</em>, <em>65 years and over</em>, and for the <em>total population</em>. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually, it could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to find partners.

**Mother's mean age at first birth (#352)**<br>
This entry provides the mean (average) age of mothers at the birth of their first child. It is a useful indicator for gauging the success of family planning programs aiming to reduce maternal mortality, increase contraceptive use – particularly among married and unmarried adolescents – delay age at first marriage, and improve the health of newborns.

**Maternal mortality rate (#353)**<br>
The maternal mortality rate (MMR) is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes). The MMR includes deaths during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, for a specified year.

**Infant mortality rate (#354)**<br>
This entry gives the number of deaths of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year. This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country.

**Life expectancy at birth (#355)**<br>
This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the future. Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial measures.

**Total fertility rate (#356)**<br>
This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting in relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining. Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for families, in some situations, to feed and educate their children and for women to enter the labor force. Rates below two children indicate populations decreasing in size and growing older. Global fertility rates are in general decline and this trend is most pronounced in industrialized countries, especially Western Europe, where populations are projected to decline dramatically over the next 50 years.

**Contraceptive prevalence rate (#357)**<br>
This field gives the percent of women of reproductive age (15-49) who are married or in union and are using, or whose sexual partner is using, a method of contraception according to the date of the most recent available data. The contraceptive prevalence rate is an indicator of health services, development, and women’s empowerment. It is also useful in understanding, past, present, and future fertility trends, especially in developing countries.

**Physicians density (#359)**<br>
This entry gives the number of medical doctors (physicians), including generalist and specialist medical practitioners, per 1,000 of the population. Medical doctors are defined as doctors that study, diagnose, treat, and prevent illness, disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in humans through the application of modern medicine. They also plan, supervise, and evaluate care and treatment plans by other health care providers. The World Health Organization estimates that fewer than 2.3 health workers (physicians, nurses, and midwives only) per 1,000 would be insufficient to achieve coverage of primary healthcare needs.

**Hospital bed density (#360)**<br>
This entry provides the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people; it serves as a general measure of inpatient service availability. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers. In most cases, beds for both acute and chronic care are included. Because the level of inpatient services required for individual countries depends on several factors - such as demographic issues and the burden of disease - there is no global target for the number of hospital beds per country. So, while 2 beds per 1,000 in one country may be sufficient, 2 beds per 1,000 in another may be woefully inadequate because of the number of people hospitalized by disease.

**Drinking water source (#361)**<br>
This entry provides information about access to improved or unimproved drinking water sources available to segments of the population of a country.&nbsp;<em>Improved</em> drinking water - use of any of the following sources: piped water into dwelling, yard, or plot; public tap or standpipe; tubewell or borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; or rainwater collection.&nbsp;<em>Unimproved</em> drinking water - use of any of the following sources: unprotected dug well; unprotected spring; cart with small tank or drum; tanker truck; surface water, which includes rivers, dams, lakes, ponds, streams, canals or irrigation channels; or bottled water.

**HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate (#363)**<br>
This entry gives an estimate of the percentage of adults (aged 15-49) living with HIV/AIDS. The adult prevalence rate is calculated by dividing the estimated number of adults living with HIV/AIDS at yearend by the total adult population at yearend.

**HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS (#364)**<br>
This entry gives an estimate of all people (adults and children) alive at yearend with HIV infection, whether or not they have developed symptoms of AIDS.

**HIV/AIDS - deaths (#365)**<br>
This entry gives an estimate of the number of adults and children who died of AIDS during a given calendar year.

**Major infectious diseases (#366)**<br>
This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases represent risks to US Government personnel traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three years. The <em>degree of risk</em> is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local population.<br />The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.<br />Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown in italics <em>and listed in typical descending order of risk</em>. Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries may vary according to local conditions.<br /><br /><em>food or waterborne diseases</em> acquired through eating or drinking on the local economy:<br /><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.<br /><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.<br /><strong>Typhoid fever</strong> - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.<br /><br /><em>vectorborne diseases</em> acquired through the bite of an infected arthropod:<br /><strong>Malaria</strong> - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa <em>Plasmodium</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of the female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito; parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain; endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the majority of 0.4-0.8 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.<br /><strong>Dengue fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.<br /><strong>Yellow fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (in urban areas <em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease; severity ranges from influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever; occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.<br /><strong>Japanese Encephalitis</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</em>) viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.<br /><strong>African Trypanosomiasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa<em> Trypanosoma</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.<br /><strong>Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa <em>leishmania</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of infection.<br /><strong>Plague</strong> - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.<br /><strong>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever</strong> - tick-borne viral disease; infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.<br /><strong>Rift Valley fever</strong> - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.<br /><strong>Chikungunya</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.<br /><br /><em>water contact diseases</em> acquired through swimming or wading in freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:<br /><strong>Leptospirosis</strong> - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans; infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.<br /><strong>Schistosomiasis</strong> - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm <em>Schistosoma</em>; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.<br /><br /><em>aerosolized dust or soil contact disease</em> acquired through inhalation of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:<br /><strong>Lassa fever</strong> - viral disease carried by rats of the genus <em>Mastomys</em>; endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in epidemic outbreaks.<br /><br /><em>respiratory disease</em> acquired through close contact with an infectious person:<br /><strong>Meningococcal meningitis</strong> - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important bacterial pathogens is <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> because of its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the "Meningitis Belt" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.<br /><br /><em>animal contact disease</em> acquired through direct contact with local animals:<br /><strong>Rabies</strong> - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.

**Obesity - adult prevalence rate (#367)**<br>
This entry gives the percent of a country's population considered to be obese. Obesity is defined as an adult having a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater to or equal to 30.0. BMI is calculated by taking a person's weight in kg and dividing it by the person's squared height in meters.

**Children under the age of 5 years underweight (#368)**<br>
This entry gives the percent of children under five considered to be underweight. Underweight means weight-for-age is approximately 2 kg below for standard at age one, 3 kg below standard for ages two and three, and 4 kg below standard for ages four and five. This statistic is an indicator of the nutritional status of a community. Children who suffer from growth retardation as a result of poor diets and/or recurrent infections tend to have a greater risk of suffering illness and death.

**Education expenditures (#369)**<br>
This entry provides the public expenditure on education as a percent of GDP.

**Literacy (#370)**<br>
This entry includes a <em>definition</em> of literacy and UNESCO's percentage estimates for populations aged 15 years and over, including <em>total population</em>, <em>males</em>, and <em>females</em>. There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of the <em>Factbook</em>. Information on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.

**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education) (#371)**<br>
School life expectancy (SLE) is the total number of years of schooling (primary to tertiary) that a child can expect to receive, assuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any particular future age is equal to the current enrollment ratio at that age.

Caution must be maintained when utilizing this indicator in international comparisons. For example, a year or grade completed in one country is not necessarily the same in terms of educational content or quality as a year or grade completed in another country. SLE represents the expected number of years of schooling that will be completed, including years spent repeating one or more grades.

**Religions (#401)**<br>
This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total population. The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's major religions are described below. <br /> <strong>Baha'i</strong> - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran in 1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one eternal transcendent God. Its guiding focus is to encourage the unity of all peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be achieved on earth. Baha'i revelation contends the prophets of major world religions reflect some truth or element of the divine, believes all were manifestations of God given to specific communities in specific times, and that Baha'u'llah is an additional prophet meant to call all humankind. Bahais are an open community, located worldwide, with the greatest concentration of believers in South Asia. <br /> <strong>Buddhism</strong> - Religion or philosophy inspired by the 5th century B.C. teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (also known as Gautama Buddha "the enlightened one"). Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path of spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of which we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of rebirth. Several schools and sects of Buddhism exist, differing often on the nature of the Buddha, the extent to which enlightenment can be achieved - for one or for all, and by whom - religious orders or laity. <br /> <em>Basic Groupings</em> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theravada Buddhism: The oldest Buddhist school, Theravada is practiced mostly in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Thailand, with minority representation elsewhere in Asia and the West. Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several lifetimes. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan (Lamaistic) Buddhism: Forms of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and parts of the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the Pali Canon and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching. Unlike Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the Buddha-nature is present in all beings and all will ultimately achieve enlightenment. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoa Hao: a minority tradition of Buddhism practiced in Vietnam that stresses lay participation, primarily by peasant farmers; it eschews expensive ceremonies and temples and relocates the primary practices into the home.<br /> <strong>Christianity</strong> - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central belief maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the Hebrew Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are salvific for the world. Christianity is one of the three monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which traces its spiritual lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures. Its sacred texts include the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or the Christian Gospels). <br /> <em>Basic Groupings</em> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest established western Christian church and the world's largest single religious body. It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical structure with the Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at the Vatican. Catholics believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head of the Church from a direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle Peter. Catholicism is comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites - one Western (Roman or Latin-Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite is by far the largest, making up about 98% of Catholic membership. Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the Maronite Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church, are in communion with Rome although they preserve their own worship traditions and their immediate hierarchy consists of clergy within their own rite. The Catholic Church has a comprehensive theological and moral doctrine specified for believers in its catechism, which makes it unique among most forms of Christianity. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mormonism (including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints): Originating in 1830 in the United States under Joseph Smith, Mormonism is not characterized as a form of Protestant Christianity because it claims additional revealed Christian scriptures after the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. The Book of Mormon maintains there was an appearance of Jesus in the New World following the Christian account of his resurrection, and that the Americas are uniquely blessed continents. Mormonism believes earlier Christian traditions, such as the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant reform faiths, are apostasies and that Joseph Smith's revelation of the Book of Mormon is a restoration of true Christianity. Mormons have a hierarchical religious leadership structure, and actively proselytize their faith; they are located primarily in the Americas and in a number of other Western countries. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehovah's Witnesses structure their faith on the Christian Bible, but their rejection of the Trinity is distinct from mainstream Christianity. They believe that a Kingdom of God, the Theocracy, will emerge following Armageddon and usher in a new earthly society. Adherents are required to evangelize and to follow a strict moral code.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch, but its various regional forms (e.g., Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox) are autocephalous (independent of Constantinople's authority, and have their own Patriarchs). Orthodox churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox Christian faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman Catholic Church, but diverges on some key premises and does not recognize the governing authority of the Pope. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in the 16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's practices, dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or denominations which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs, relationship to state, clergy, and governance. Many protestant theologies emphasize the primary role of scripture in their faith, advocating individual interpretation of Christian texts without the mediation of a final religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The oldest Protestant Christianities include Lutheranism, Calvinism (Presbyterians), and Anglican Christianity (Episcopalians), which have established liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy. Other variants on Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal movements and independent churches, may lack one or more of these elements, and their leadership and beliefs are individualized and dynamic. <br /> <strong>Hinduism</strong> - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second and first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of beliefs and practices with no single founder or religious authority. Hinduism has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita are among some of the most important. Hindus may worship one or many deities, usually with prayer rituals within their own home. The most common figures of devotion are the gods Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the soul, or <em>atman</em>, is eternal, and goes through a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (<em>samsara</em>) determined by one's positive or negative karma, or the consequences of one's actions. The goal of religious life is to learn to act so as to finally achieve liberation (<em>moksha</em>) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle. <br /> <strong>Islam</strong> - The third of the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century. Muslims believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets (beginning with Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic scripture, was revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word submission, and obedience to God is a primary theme in this religion. In order to live an Islamic life, believers must follow the five pillars, or tenets, of Islam, which are the testimony of faith (<em>shahada</em>), daily prayer (<em>salah</em>), giving alms (<em>zakah</em>), fasting during Ramadan (<em>sawm</em>), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (<em>hajj</em>). <br /> <em>Basic Groupings</em> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about the rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam (religious leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs after Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam, Sunnis and Shia continue to have different views of acceptable schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic religious authority. Islam also has an active mystical branch, Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia subsets. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sunni Islam accounts for over 75% of the world's Muslim population. It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after Muhammad. Sunni has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law - Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the <em>Hadith</em>, or recorded oral traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may elect to follow any one of these schools, as all are considered equally valid. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shia Islam represents 10-20% of Muslims worldwide, and its distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible, divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim community after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as "Twelvers," because they believe that the 11 familial successor imams after Muhammad culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is hidden in the world and will reappear at its end to redeem the righteous. <br /> <em>Variants</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known as "Seveners," because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam in Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq. Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as the Mahdi, or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in various parts of the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are a closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia Muslims, although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have a syncretic mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East. Alawis live mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing that the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key aspects of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the word, the soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key presence in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. <br /> <strong>Jainism</strong> - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes in an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of "the own nature of things." It emphasizes compassion for all living things, seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation through enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the belief in the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain philosophy teaches non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for monks and laity alike; its adherents are a highly influential religious minority in Indian society. <br /> <strong>Judaism</strong> - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely dating to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the Jewish people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility between a sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of Judaism's Hebrew Bible, or <em>Tanakh</em>. Divine revelation of principles and prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish law, or <em>halakhah</em>, which is a key component of the faith. While there are extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological discourse, there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition. Local communities have their own religious leadership. Modern Judaism has three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of Jewish law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional practice, and Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of individualized interpretations of Jewish identity and faith. <br /> <strong>Shintoism</strong> - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is based upon the premise that every being and object has its own spirit or <em>kami</em>. Shinto practitioners worship several particular <em>kamis</em>, including the <em>kamis</em> of nature, and families often have shrines to their ancestors' <em>kamis</em>. Shintoism has no fixed tradition of prayers or prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual ritual. Respect for the <em>kamis</em> in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior to the end of World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan, and bolstered the cult of the Japanese emperor. <br /> <strong>Sikhism</strong> - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in a non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering one's devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of rebirth. Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent gurus. Their scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the Adi Granth - is considered the living Guru, or final authority of Sikh faith and theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind and disavows caste, class, or gender discrimination. <br /> <strong>Taoism</strong> - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow of the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a principle of non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously with the Tao. Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a perfect harmonious balance and nature, while in the manifest world - particularly in the body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of the Tao - compassion, simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis for Taoist ethics. <br /> <strong>Zoroastrianism</strong> - Originating from the teachings of Zoroaster in about the 9th or 10th century B.C., Zoroastrianism may be the oldest continuing creedal religion. Its key beliefs center on a transcendent creator God, Ahura Mazda, and the concept of free will. The key ethical tenets of Zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture, the Avesta, are based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent chaos if one chooses to serve God and exercises good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. Zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion and members are almost always born to Zoroastrian parents. Prior to the spread of Islam, Zoroastrianism dominated greater Iran. Today, though a minority, Zoroastrians remain primarily in Iran, India (where they are known as Parsi), and Pakistan. <br /> <strong>Traditional beliefs</strong><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Animism: the belief that non-human entities contain souls or spirits.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Badimo: a form of ancestor worship of the Tswana people of Botswana.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confucianism: an ideology that humans are perfectible through self-cultivation and self-creation; developed from teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. Confucianism has strongly influenced the culture and beliefs of East Asian countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inuit beliefs are a form of shamanism (see below) based on animistic principles of the Inuit or Eskimo peoples.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kirant: the belief system of the Kirat, a people who live mainly in the Himalayas of Nepal. It is primarily a form of polytheistic shamanism, but includes elements of animism and ancestor worship. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pagan is a blanket term used to describe many unconnected belief practices throughout history, usually in reference to religions outside of the Abrahamic category (monotheistic faiths like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shamanism: beliefs and practices promoting communication with the spiritual world. Shamanistic beliefs are organized around a shaman or medicine man who - as an intermediary between the human and spirit world - is believed to be able to heal the sick (by healing their souls), communicate with the spirit world, and help souls into the afterlife through the practice of entering a trance. In shaman-based religions, the shaman is also responsible for leading sacred rites.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spiritualism: the belief that souls and spirits communicate with the living usually through intermediaries called mediums. <br /> <strong>Syncretic</strong> (fusion of diverse religious beliefs and practices) <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cao Dai: a nationalistic Vietnamese sect, officially established in 1926, that draws practices and precepts from Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Catholicism.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chondogyo: or the religion of the Heavenly Way, is based on Korean shamanism, Buddhism, and Korean folk traditions, with some elements drawn from Christianity. Formulated in the 1860s, it holds that God lives in all of us and strives to convert society into a paradise on earth, populated by believers transformed into intelligent moral beings with a high social conscience.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kimbanguist: a puritan form of the Baptist denomination founded by Simon Kimbangu in the 1920s in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Adherents believe that salvation comes through Jesus' death and resurrection, like Christianity, but additionally that living a spiritually pure life following strict codes of conduct is required for salvation. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modekngei: a hybrid of Christianity and ancient Palauan culture and oral traditions founded around 1915 on the island of Babeldaob. Adherents simultaneously worship Jesus Christ and Palauan goddesses. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rastafarian: an afro-centrist ideology and movement based on Christianity that arose in Jamaica in the 1930s; it believes that Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-74, was the incarnation of the second coming of Jesus.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Santeria: practiced in Cuba, the merging of the Yoruba religion of Nigeria with Roman Catholicism and native Indian traditions. Its practitioners believe that each person has a destiny and eventually transcends to merge with the divine creator and source of all energy, Olorun. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Voodoo/Vodun: a form of spirit and ancestor worship combined with some Christian faiths, especially Catholicism. Haitian and Louisiana Voodoo, which have included more Catholic practices, are separate from West African Vodun, which has retained a focus on spirit worship. <br /> <strong>Non-religious</strong><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Agnosticism: the belief that most things are unknowable. In regard to religion it is usually characterized as neither a belief nor non belief in a deity.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Atheism: the belief that there are no deities of any kind.

<p><em>ten hottest places on earth (highest average monthly temperature)</em> describes the temperature measured both in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit as well the month of the year for selected countries with climate extremes.</p>

**Land use (#288)**<br>
This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three different types of land use: <em>agricultural land, forest, and other</em>; <em>agricultural land</em> is further divided into <em>arable land</em> - land cultivated for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest, <em>permanent crops</em> - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest, and includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, and <em>permanent pastures</em> and meadows &ndash; land used for at least five years or more to grow herbaceous forage, either cultivated or growing naturally; <em>forest</em> area is land spanning more than 0.5 hectare with trees higher than five meters and a canopy cover of more than 10% to include windbreaks, shelterbelts, and corridors of trees greater than 0.5 hectare and at least 20 m wide; land classified as <em>other</em> includes built-up areas, roads and other transportation features, barren land, or wasteland.

**Total renewable water resources (#290)**<br>
<p>This entry provides the long-term average water availability for a country measured in cubic meters per year of precipitation, recharged ground water, and surface inflows from surrounding countries.&nbsp; Total renewable water resources provides the water total available to a country but does not include water resource totals that have been reserved for upstream or downstream countries through international agreements.&nbsp; Note that these values are averages and do not accurately reflect the total available in any given year.&nbsp; Annual available resources can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and weather variations.</p>

**Environment - current issues (#293)**<br>
This entry lists the most pressing and important environmental problems. The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry: <br /><strong>Acidification</strong> - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid rain). <br /><strong>Acid rain</strong> - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in New England. <br /><strong>Aerosol</strong> - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke, or fog. <br /><strong>Afforestation</strong> - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that have been cut or destroyed by fire. <br /><strong>Asbestos</strong> - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in particulate form. <br /><strong>Biodiversity</strong> - also biological diversity; the relative number of species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism, community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption. <br /><strong>Bio-indicators</strong> - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat. <br /><strong>Biomass</strong> - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area or volume. <br /><strong>Carbon cycle</strong> - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits. <br /><strong>Catchments</strong> - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar. <br /><strong>DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane)</strong> - a colorless, odorless insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was banned in the US in 1972. <br /><strong>Defoliants</strong> - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control, and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health. <br /><strong>Deforestation</strong> - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g., unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing, and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without planting new growth. <br /><strong>Desertification</strong> - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive soils, or climate change. <br /><strong>Dredging</strong> - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems. <br /><strong>Drift-net fishing</strong> - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of "sweeping the ocean clean." <br /><strong>Ecosystems</strong> - ecological units comprised of complex communities of organisms and their specific environments. <br /><strong>Effluent</strong>s - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it. <br /><strong>Endangered species</strong> - a species that is threatened with extinction either by direct hunting or habitat destruction. <br /><strong>Freshwater</strong> - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers. <br /><strong>Greenhouse gas</strong> - a gas that"traps" infrared radiation in the lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. <br /><strong>Groundwater</strong> - water sources found below the surface of the earth often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source for wells and natural springs. <br /><strong>Highlands Water Project</strong> - a series of dams constructed jointly by Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders economic resources. <br /><strong>Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC)</strong> - represents the roughly 150,000 Inuits of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia in international environmental issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change. <br /><strong>Metallurgical plants</strong> - industries which specialize in the science, technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of ground water and air when not properly disposed. <br /><strong>Noxious substances</strong> - injurious, very harmful to living beings. <br /><strong>Overgrazing</strong> - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land. <br /><strong>Ozone shield</strong> - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3) that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living organisms. <br /><strong>Poaching</strong> - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with respect to endangered or threatened species. <br /><strong>Pollution</strong> - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made waste. <br /><strong>Potable water</strong> - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed. <br /><strong>Salination</strong> - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops. <br /><strong>Siltation</strong> - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion. <br /><strong>Slash-and-burn agriculture</strong> - a rotating cultivation technique in which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the environment. <br /><strong>Soil degradation</strong> - damage to the land's productive capacity because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce agricultural products. <br /><strong>Soil erosion</strong> - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind, compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing, and desertification. <br /><strong>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation</strong> - a portion of the electromagnetic energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans. <br /><strong>Waterborne diseases</strong> - those in which bacteria survive in, and are transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an untreated water supply.

**Environment - international agreements (#294)**<br>
This entry separates country participation in international environmental agreements into two levels - <em>party to</em> and <em>signed, but not ratified</em>. Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.

**Urbanization (#349)**<br>
This entry provides two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, <em> urban population</em>, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country. The second, <em>rate of urbanization</em>, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time. It is possible for a country with a 100% urban population to still display a change in the rate of urbanization (up or down). For example, a population of 100,000 that is 100% urban can change in size to 110,000 or 90,000 but remain 100% urban.<br /><br />Additionally, the World entry includes a list of the <em>ten largest urban agglomerations</em>. An <em>urban agglomeration</em> is defined as comprising the city or town proper and also the suburban fringe or thickly settled territory lying outside of, but adjacent to, the boundaries of the city.

**Major infectious diseases (#366)**<br>
This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered in countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very high as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases represent risks to US Government personnel traveling to the specified country for a period of less than three years. The <em>degree of risk</em> is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the local population.<br />The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.<br />Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown in italics <em>and listed in typical descending order of risk</em>. Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries may vary according to local conditions.<br /><br /><em>food or waterborne diseases</em> acquired through eating or drinking on the local economy:<br /><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.<br /><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.<br /><strong>Typhoid fever</strong> - bacterial disease spread through contact with food or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.<br /><br /><em>vectorborne diseases</em> acquired through the bite of an infected arthropod:<br /><strong>Malaria</strong> - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa <em>Plasmodium</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of the female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito; parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain; endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the majority of 0.4-0.8 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.<br /><strong>Dengue fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.<br /><strong>Yellow fever</strong> - mosquito-borne (in urban areas <em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease; severity ranges from influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever; occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.<br /><strong>Japanese Encephalitis</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</em>) viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality rates 30%.<br /><strong>African Trypanosomiasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa<em> Trypanosoma</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and, in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the parasites.<br /><strong>Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</strong> - caused by the parasitic protozoa <em>leishmania</em>; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries; 90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans can act as reservoirs of infection.<br /><strong>Plague</strong> - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible; recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages; manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes; disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.<br /><strong>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever</strong> - tick-borne viral disease; infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose, and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.<br /><strong>Rift Valley fever</strong> - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects; infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.<br /><strong>Chikungunya</strong> - mosquito-borne (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) viral disease associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever; characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.<br /><br /><em>water contact diseases</em> acquired through swimming or wading in freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:<br /><strong>Leptospirosis</strong> - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans; infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated recovery can take months.<br /><strong>Schistosomiasis</strong> - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm <em>Schistosoma</em>; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74 developing countries with 80% of infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.<br /><br /><em>aerosolized dust or soil contact disease</em> acquired through inhalation of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:<br /><strong>Lassa fever</strong> - viral disease carried by rats of the genus <em>Mastomys</em>; endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50% in epidemic outbreaks.<br /><br /><em>respiratory disease</em> acquired through close contact with an infectious person:<br /><strong>Meningococcal meningitis</strong> - bacterial disease causing an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most important bacterial pathogens is <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> because of its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases, typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the "Meningitis Belt" which stretches from Senegal east to Ethiopia.<br /><br /><em>animal contact disease</em> acquired through direct contact with local animals:<br /><strong>Rabies</strong> - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of symptoms.

**Marine fisheries (#408)**<br>
This entry describes the major fisheries in the world's oceans in terms of the area covered, their ranking in terms of the global catch, the main producing countries, and the principal species caught. Information provided by the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

**Air pollutants (#416)**<br>
<p>This entry refers to specified gases and particulates released by various sources of animals, plants, goods, and processes that can contribute to global warming, poor air quality, pollution, and climate change.<br /><br /><em>carbon dioxide emissions</em> - This entry provides the annual quantity of carbon dioxide emissions for a country, as measured in megatons.&nbsp; Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas emitted through human-influenced and natural processes. Human-influenced sources include the burning of fossil fuels (including coal, natural gas, and oil), solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, as well as certain chemical processes, such as cement production. Natural sources include decomposition, ocean release, and respiration. Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to climate warming, air quality, global warming, and pollution.<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>Methane emissions</em> - This entry provides the annual quantity of methane emissions for a country, as measured in megatons. Methane is a greenhouse gas emitted from the breakdown of organic material from human-influenced and natural processes. Human-influenced sources include the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil; the decay of organic waste in landfills; agricultural activities; stationary and mobile combustion; waste water treatment; and certain industrial processes. Natural sources include the decay of plant material in wetlands, the seepage of gas from underground deposits, and the digestion of food by ruminants. Methane emissions cause poor air quality, health issues for animals and humans, and reduced crop yields, and are a contributor to climate change.<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>Particulate matter emissions</em> - This entry provides the modeled annual mean concentration of particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) measured in micrograms per cubic meter of air. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5 </sub>pollutants should not exceed an annual mean concentration of 10 micrograms per cubic meter, according to World Health Organization guidelines. Particulate matter are inhalable and respirable particles composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust, and water. Fine particles less than 2.5 microns pose the greatest health risks because they can penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Sources include combustion engines, solid-fuel combustion, and other industrial activities. Exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, although even low concentrations of particulate matter can impact health. By reducing air pollution levels, countries can decrease the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.</p>

**Total water withdrawal (#417)**<br>
<p>This entry provides the annual quantity of water in cubic meters withdrawn for municipal, industrial, and agricultural purposes.&nbsp; Municipal sector use refers to the annual quantity of water withdrawn primarily for direct use by the population through the public distribution network.&nbsp; Industrial sector use refers to the annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for industrial purposes.&nbsp; Agricultural sector use refers to the annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for irrigation, livestock, and aquaculture purposes.</p>

**Food insecurity (#418)**<br>
Food crises are nearly always due to a combination of factors, but it is important to establish whether the nature of food crises is predominantly related to lack of food availability, limited access to food, or severe but localized problems. Countries in crisis requiring external assistance for food are expected to lack the resources to deal with reported critical problems of food insecurity. Three levels of crises are described in this field in descending severity: countries facing an <strong>exceptional shortfall in aggregate food production/supplies</strong> as a result of crop failure, natural disasters, interruption of imports, disruption of distribution, excessive post-harvest losses, or other supply bottlenecks; countries with <strong>widespread lack of access</strong>, where a majority of the population is considered to be unable to procure food from local markets, due to very low incomes, exceptionally high food prices, or the inability to circulate within the country; countries with <strong>severe localized food insecurity</strong> due to the influx of refugees, a concentration of internally displaced persons, or areas with combinations of crop failure and deep poverty.

**Revenue from forest resources (#420)**<br>
This entry refers to the economic profits, expressed as a percentage of a country's GDP, from the harvesting of forests (e.g., lumber and timber industries). These profits equal forest gross revenues minus costs to harvest the forest. Other sources may refer to this field as forest rents.

**Revenue from coal (#421)**<br>
This entry refers to the economic profits, expressed as a percentage of a country's GDP, from the extraction of coal. These profits equal coal gross revenues minus cost(s) to extract the coal. Other sources may refer to this field as coal rents.

**Waste and recycling (#422)**<br>
<p>This entry provides the amount of municipal solid waste a country produces annually and the amount of that waste that is recycled. Municipal solid waste consists of everyday items that are used and thrown away, including product packaging, furniture, clothing, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, grass clippings, appliances, paint, and batteries. Municipal solid waste - often referred to as trash or garbage - comes from homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses. Recycling is the process of collecting and processing materials that would otherwise be thrown away as trash and turning them into new products. Recycling benefits both communities and the environment.</p>
<p>This entry includes three subfields: <em>annual amount of municipal solid waste generated</em> (tons), <em>annual amount of municipal solid waste recycled</em> (tons), and <em>percent of municipal solid waste recycled</em>.</p>

**Dependency status (#298)**<br>
This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.

**Government type (#299)**<br>
This entry gives the basic form of government. Definitions of the major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that for some countries more than one definition applies.):

<br><b>Absolute monarchy</b> - a form of government where the monarch rules unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally organized opposition.

<br><b>Anarchy</b> - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought about by the absence of governmental authority. 

<br><b>Authoritarian</b> - a form of government in which state authority is imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.

<br><b>Commonwealth</b> - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on law and united by a compact of the people for the common good. 

<br><b>Communist</b> - a system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people (i.e., a classless society). 

<br><b>Confederacy (Confederation)</b> - a union by compact or treaty between states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme authority over all matters except those delegated to the central government. 

<br><b>Constitutional</b> - a government by or operating under an authoritative document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and limits of that government. 

<br><b>Constitutional democracy</b> - a form of government in which the sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing constitution. 

<br><b>Constitutional monarchy</b> - a system of government in which a monarch is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom. 

<br><b>Democracy</b> - a form of government in which the supreme power is retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly through a system of representation and delegated authority periodically renewed. 

<br><b>Democratic republic</b> - a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them. 

<br><b>Dictatorship</b> - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws). 

<br><b>Ecclesiastical</b> - a government administrated by a church.

<br><b>Emirate</b> - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority. 

<br><b>Federal (Federation)</b> - a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a central authority and a number of constituent regions (states, colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals as well as upon the regional units. 

<br><b>Federal republic</b> - a state in which the powers of the central government are restricted and in which the component parts (states, colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental representatives.

<br><b>Islamic republic</b> - a particular form of government adopted by some Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the laws of Islam. 

<br><b>Maoism</b> - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch with the people. 

<br><b>Marxism</b> - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by 19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists (business owners), to a socialist"dictatorship of the proletariat," to, finally, a classless society - Communism. 

<br><b>Marxism-Leninism</b> - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed to underdeveloped countries. 

<br><b>Monarchy</b> - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with constitutionally limited authority. 

<br><b>Oligarchy</b> - a government in which control is exercised by a small group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power. 

<br><b>Parliamentary democracy</b> - a political system in which the legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the parliament. 

<br><b>Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government)</b> - a government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer function. 

<br><b>Parliamentary monarchy</b> - a state headed by a monarch who is not actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity); true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a legislature (parliament). 

<br><b>Presidential</b> - a system of government where the executive branch exists separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not accountable). 

<br><b>Republic</b> - a representative democracy in which the people's elected deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on legislation.

<br><b>Socialism</b> - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite. 

<br><b>Sultanate</b> - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with constitutionally limited authority. 

<br><b>Theocracy</b> - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government subject to religious authority.

<br><b>Totalitarian</b> - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.

**Capital (#301)**<br>
This entry gives the <em>name</em> of the seat of government, its <em>geographic coordinates</em>, the <em>time difference</em> relative to <B>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</B> and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if applicable, information on <em>daylight saving time</em> <B>(DST)</B>. Where appropriate, a special <em>note</em> has been added to highlight those countries that have multiple time zones.

**Administrative divisions (#302)**<br>
This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by the BGN are noted. Geographic names conform to spellings approved by the BGN with the exception of the omission of diacritical marks and special characters.

**Dependent areas (#304)**<br>
This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.

**Independence (#305)**<br>
For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other countries, the date given may not represent "independence" in the strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form of government, or state succession. For a number of countries, the establishment of statehood was a lengthy evolutionary process occurring over decades or even centuries. In such cases, several significant dates are cited. Dependent areas include the notation "none" followed by the nature of their dependency status. Also see the <b>Terminology</b> note.

**National holiday (#306)**<br>
This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually independence day.

**Constitution (#307)**<br>
This entry provides information on a country&rsquo;s constitution and includes two subfields. The history subfield includes the dates of previous constitutions and the main steps and dates in formulating and implementing the latest constitution. For countries with 1-3 previous constitutions, the years are listed; for those with 4-9 previous, the entry is listed as &ldquo;several previous,&rdquo; and for those with 10 or more, the entry is &ldquo;many previous.&rdquo; The amendments subfield summarizes the process of amending a country&rsquo;s constitution &ndash; from proposal through passage &ndash; and the dates of amendments, which are treated in the same manner as the constitution dates. Where appropriate, summaries are composed from English-language translations of non-English constitutions, which derive from official or non-official translations or machine translators.<br /><br /> The main steps in creating a constitution and amending it usually include the following steps: proposal, drafting, legislative and/or executive branch review and approval, public referendum, and entry into law. In many countries this process is lengthy. Terms commonly used to describe constitutional changes are &ldquo;amended,&rdquo; &ldquo;revised,&rdquo; or &ldquo;reformed.&rdquo; In countries such as South Korea and Turkmenistan, sources differ as to whether changes are stated as new constitutions or are amendments/revisions to existing ones.<br /><br /> A few countries including Canada, Israel, and the UK have no single constitution document, but have various written and unwritten acts, statutes, common laws, and practices that, when taken together, describe a body of fundamental principles or established precedents as to how their countries are governed. Some special regions (Hong Kong, Macau) and countries (Oman, Saudi Arabia) use the term &ldquo;basic law&rdquo; instead of constitution.<br /><br /> A number of self-governing dependencies and territories such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and Gibraltar (UK), Greenland and Faroe Islands (Denmark), Aruba, Curacao, and Sint Maarten (Netherlands), and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (US) have their own constitutions.

**Legal system (#308)**<br>
This entry provides the description of a country's legal system. A statement on judicial review of legislative acts is also included for a number of countries. The legal systems of nearly all countries are generally modeled upon elements of five main types: civil law (including French law, the Napoleonic Code, Roman law, Roman-Dutch law, and Spanish law); common law (including United State law); customary law; mixed or pluralistic law; and religious law (including Islamic law). An additional type of legal system - international law, which governs the conduct of independent nations in their relationships with one another - is also addressed below. The following list describes these legal systems, the countries or world regions where these systems are enforced, and a brief statement on the origins and major features of each.
<br>
<b>Civil Law</b> - The most widespread type of legal system in the world, applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is derived mainly from the Roman <em>Corpus Juris Civilus</em>, (Body of Civil Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and 565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments - and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are based on more than one code.
<br>
<b>Common Law</b> - A type of legal system, often synonymous with"English common law," which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans. Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally. Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were "common" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English common law is "legal precedent" - referred to as <em>stare decisis</em>, meaning "to stand by things decided." In the English common law system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time - by the judges of earlier English courts.
<br>
<b>Customary Law</b> - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of, or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40 countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands, Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as"primitive law," "unwritten law," "indigenous law," and "folk law." There is no single history of customary law such as that found in Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and they are agreed upon by members of the community. Although such law systems include sanctions for law infractions, resolution tends to be reconciliatory rather than punitive. A number of African states practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences. Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial powers.
<br>
<b>European Union Law</b> - A sub-discipline of international law known as"supranational law" in which the rights of sovereign nations are limited in relation to one another. Also referred to as the Law of the European Union or Community Law, it is the unique and complex legal system that operates in tandem with the laws of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU). Similar to federal states, the EU legal system ensures compliance from the member states because of the Union's decentralized political nature. The European Court of Justice (ECJ), established in 1952 by the Treaty of Paris, has been largely responsible for the development of EU law. Fundamental principles of European Union law include: <em>subsidiarity</em> - the notion that issues be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority; <em>proportionality</em> - the EU may only act to the extent needed to achieve its objectives; <em>conferral</em> - the EU is a union of member states, and all its authorities are voluntarily granted by its members; <em>legal certainty</em> - requires that legal rules be clear and precise; and <em>precautionary principle</em> - a moral and political principle stating that if an action or policy might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue, the burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action.
 <br>
<b>French Law</b> - A type of civil law that is the legal system of France. The French system also serves as the basis for, or is mixed with, other legal systems in approximately 50 countries, notably in North Africa, the Near East, and the French territories and dependencies. French law is primarily codified or systematic written civil law. Prior to the French Revolution (1789-1799), France had no single national legal system. Laws in the northern areas of present-day France were mostly local customs based on privileges and exemptions granted by kings and feudal lords, while in the southern areas Roman law predominated. The introduction of the Napoleonic Civil Code during the reign of Napoleon I in the first decade of the 19th century brought major reforms to the French legal system, many of which remain part of France's current legal structure, though all have been extensively amended or redrafted to address a modern nation. French law distinguishes between"public law" and "private law." Public law relates to government, the French Constitution, public administration, and criminal law. Private law covers issues between private citizens or corporations. The most recent changes to the French legal system - introduced in the 1980s - were the decentralization laws, which transferred authority from centrally appointed government representatives to locally elected representatives of the people.
<br>
<b>International Law</b> - The law of the international community, or the body of customary rules and treaty rules accepted as legally binding by states in their relations with each other. International law differs from other legal systems in that it primarily concerns sovereign political entities. There are three separate disciplines of international law: public international law, which governs the relationship between provinces and international entities and includes treaty law, law of the sea, international criminal law, and international humanitarian law; private international law, which addresses legal jurisdiction; and supranational law - a legal framework wherein countries are bound by regional agreements in which the laws of the member countries are held inapplicable when in conflict with supranational laws. At present the European Union is the only entity under a supranational legal system. The term"international law" was coined by Jeremy Bentham in 1780 in his <em>Principles of Morals and Legislation</em>, though laws governing relations between states have been recognized from very early times (many centuries B.C.). Modern international law developed alongside the emergence and growth of the European nation-states beginning in the early 16th century. Other factors that influenced the development of international law included the revival of legal studies, the growth of international trade, and the practice of exchanging emissaries and establishing legations. The sources of International law are set out in Article 38-1 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice within the UN Charter.
<br>
<b>Islamic Law</b> - The most widespread type of religious law, it is the legal system enforced in over 30 countries, particularly in the Near East, but also in Central and South Asia, Africa, and Indonesia. In many countries Islamic law operates in tandem with a civil law system. Islamic law is embodied in the sharia, an Arabic word meaning"the right path." Sharia covers all aspects of public and private life and organizes them into five categories: obligatory, recommended, permitted, disliked, and forbidden. The primary sources of sharia law are the Qur'an, believed by Muslims to be the word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel, and the Sunnah, the teachings of the Prophet and his works. In addition to these two primary sources, traditional Sunni Muslims recognize the consensus of Muhammad's companions and Islamic jurists on certain issues, called ijmas, and various forms of reasoning, including analogy by legal scholars, referred to as qiyas. Shia Muslims reject ijmas and qiyas as sources of sharia law.
<br>
<b>Mixed Law</b> - Also referred to as pluralistic law, mixed law consists of elements of some or all of the other main types of legal systems - civil, common, customary, and religious. The mixed legal systems of a number of countries came about when colonial powers overlaid their own legal systems upon colonized regions but retained elements of the colonies' existing legal systems.
<br>
<b>Napoleonic Civil Code</b> - A type of civil law, referred to as the Civil Code or <em>Code Civil des Francais</em>, forms part of the legal system of France, and underpins the legal systems of Bolivia, Egypt, Lebanon, Poland, and the US state of Louisiana. The Civil Code was established under Napoleon I, enacted in 1804, and officially designated the <em>Code Napoleon</em> in 1807. This legal system combined the Teutonic civil law tradition of the northern provinces of France with the Roman law tradition of the southern and eastern regions of the country. The Civil Code bears similarities in its arrangement to the Roman <em>Body of Civil Law</em> (see Civil Law above). As enacted in 1804, the Code addressed personal status, property, and the acquisition of property. Codes added over the following six years included civil procedures, commercial law, criminal law and procedures, and a penal code.
<br>
<b>Religious Law</b> - A legal system which stems from the sacred texts of religious traditions and in most cases professes to cover all aspects of life as a seamless part of devotional obligations to a transcendent, imminent, or deep philosophical reality. Implied as the basis of religious law is the concept of unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments. However, a detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. The main types of religious law are sharia in Islam, halakha in Judaism, and canon law in some Christian groups. Sharia is the most widespread religious legal system (see Islamic Law), and is the sole system of law for countries including Iran, the Maldives, and Saudi Arabia. No country is fully governed by halakha, but Jewish people may decide to settle disputes through Jewish courts and be bound by their rulings. Canon law is not a divine law as such because it is not found in revelation. It is viewed instead as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. Canon law regulates the internal ordering of the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion.

<b>Roman Law</b> - A type of civil law developed in ancient Rome and practiced from the time of the city's founding (traditionally 753 B.C.) until the fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century A.D. Roman law remained the legal system of the Byzantine (Eastern Empire) until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Preserved fragments of the first legal text, known as the Law of the Twelve Tables, dating from the 5th century B.C., contained specific provisions designed to change the prevailing customary law. Early Roman law was drawn from custom and statutes; later, during the time of the empire, emperors asserted their authority as the ultimate source of law. The basis for Roman laws was the idea that the exact form - not the intention - of words or of actions produced legal consequences. It was only in the late 6th century A.D. that a comprehensive Roman code of laws was published (see Civil Law above). Roman law served as the basis of law systems developed in a number of continental European countries.
<br>
<b>Roman-Dutch Law</b> - A type of civil law based on Roman law as applied in the Netherlands. Roman-Dutch law serves as the basis for legal systems in seven African countries, as well as Guyana, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. This law system, which originated in the province of Holland and expanded throughout the Netherlands (to be replaced by the French Civil Code in 1809), was instituted in a number of sub-Saharan African countries during the Dutch colonial period. The Dutch jurist/philosopher Hugo Grotius was the first to attempt to reduce Roman-Dutch civil law into a system in his <em>Jurisprudence of Holland</em> (written 1619-20, commentary published 1621). The Dutch historian/lawyer Simon van Leeuwen coined the term"Roman-Dutch law" in 1652.
<br>
<b>Spanish Law</b> - A type of civil law, often referred to as the Spanish Civil Code, it is the present legal system of Spain and is the basis of legal systems in 12 countries mostly in Central and South America, but also in southwestern Europe, northern and western Africa, and southeastern Asia. The Spanish Civil Code reflects a complex mixture of customary, Roman, Napoleonic, local, and modern codified law. The laws of the Visigoth invaders of Spain in the 5th to 7th centuries had the earliest major influence on Spanish legal system development. The Christian Reconquest of Spain in the 11th through 15th centuries witnessed the development of customary law, which combined canon (religious) and Roman law. During several centuries of Hapsburg and Bourbon rule, systematic recompilations of the existing national legal system were attempted, but these often conflicted with local and regional customary civil laws. Legal system development for most of the 19th century concentrated on formulating a national civil law system, which was finally enacted in 1889 as the Spanish Civil Code. Several sections of the code have been revised, the most recent of which are the penal code in 1989 and the judiciary code in 2001. The Spanish Civil Code separates public and private law. Public law includes constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law, process law, financial and tax law, and international public law. Private law includes civil law, commercial law, labor law, and international private law.

<b>United States Law</b> - A type of common law, which is the basis of the legal system of the United States and that of its island possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific. This legal system has several layers, more possibly than in most other countries, and is due in part to the division between federal and state law. The United States was founded not as one nation but as a union of 13 colonies, each claiming independence from the British Crown. The US Constitution, implemented in 1789, began shifting power away from the states and toward the federal government, though the states today retain substantial legal authority. US law draws its authority from four sources: <em>constitutional law</em>, <em>statutory law</em>, <em>administrative regulations</em>, and <em>case law</em>. Constitutional law is based on the US Constitution and serves as the supreme federal law. Taken together with those of the state constitutions, these documents outline the general structure of the federal and state governments and provide the rules and limits of power. US statutory law is legislation enacted by the US Congress and is codified in the United States Code. The 50 state legislatures have similar authority to enact state statutes. Administrative law is the authority delegated to federal and state executive agencies. Case law, also referred to as common law, covers areas where constitutional or statutory law is lacking. Case law is a collection of judicial decisions, customs, and general principles that began in England centuries ago, that were adopted in America at the time of the Revolution, and that continue to develop today.

**International law organization participation (#309)**<br>
This entry includes information on a country's acceptance of jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and of the International Criminal Court (ICCt); 59 countries have accepted ICJ jurisdiction with reservations and 11 have accepted ICJ jurisdiction without reservations; 122 countries have accepted ICCt jurisdiction. <a href = "../appendix/appendix-b.html"<b>Appendix B: International Organizations and Groups</b></a> explains the differing mandates of the ICJ and ICCt.

**Citizenship (#310)**<br>
This entry provides information related to the acquisition and exercise of citizenship; it includes four subfields:<br /><br /> <em>citizenship by birth</em> describes the acquisition of citizenship based on place of birth, known as <em>Jus soli</em>, regardless of the citizenship of parents.<br /><br /> <em>citizenship by descent only</em> describes the acquisition of citizenship based on the principle of <em>Jus sanguinis</em>, or by descent, where at least one parent is a citizen of the state and being born within the territorial limits of the state is not required. The majority of countries adhere to this practice. In some cases, citizenship is conferred through the father or mother exclusively.<br /><br /> <em>dual citizenship recognized</em> indicates whether a state permits a citizen to simultaneously hold citizenship in another state. Many states do not permit dual citizenship and the voluntary acquisition of citizenship in another country is grounds for revocation of citizenship. Holding dual citizenship makes an individual legally obligated to more than one state and can negate the normal consular protections afforded to citizens outside their original country of citizenship.<br /><br /> <em>residency requirement for naturalization</em> lists the length of time an applicant is required to live in a state before applying for naturalization. In most countries citizenship can be acquired through the legal process of naturalization. The requirements for naturalization vary by state but generally include no criminal record, good health, economic wherewithal, and a period of authorized residency in the state. This time period can vary enormously among states and is often used to make the acquisition of citizenship difficult or impossible.

**Suffrage (#311)**<br>
This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to vote is universal or restricted.

**Executive branch (#312)**<br>
This entry includes five subentries: <em>chief of state; head of government; cabinet; elections/appointments; election results</em>. <em>Chief of state</em> includes the name, title, and beginning date in office of the titular leader of the country who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. <em>Head of government</em> includes the name, title of the top executive designated to manage the executive branch of the government, and the beginning date in office. <em>Cabinet</em> includes the official name of the executive branch’s high-ranking body and the method of member selection. <em>Elections/appointments</em> includes the process for accession to office, date of the last election, and date of the next election. <em>Election results</em> includes each candidate's political affiliation, percent of direct popular vote or indirect legislative/parliamentary percent vote or vote count in the last election.<br><br>
The executive branches in approximately 80% of the world's countries have separate chiefs of state and heads of government; for the remainder, the chief of state is also the head of government, such as in Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, the US, and Venezuela. Chiefs of state in just over 100 countries are directly elected, most by majority popular vote; those in another 55 are indirectly elected by their national legislatures, parliaments, or electoral colleges. Another 29 countries have a monarch as the chief of state. In dependencies, territories, and collectivities of sovereign countries - except those of the US - representatives are appointed to serve as chiefs of state.<br><br> 
Heads of government in the majority of countries are appointed either by the president or the monarch or selected by the majority party in the legislative body. Excluding countries where the chief of state is also head of government, in only a few countries is the head of government directly elected through popular vote.<br><br>
Most of the world's countries have cabinets, the majority of which are appointed by the chief of state or prime minister, many in consultation with each other or with the legislature. Cabinets in only about a dozen countries are elected solely by their legislative bodies.

**Legislative branch (#313)**<br>
This entry has three subfields. The <em>description</em> subfield provides the legislative structure (unicameral – single house; bicameral – an upper and a lower house); formal name(s); number of member seats; types of constituencies or voting districts (single seat, multi-seat, nationwide); electoral voting system(s); and member term of office. The elections subfield includes the dates of the last election and next election. The <em>election results</em> subfield lists <em>percent of vote by party/coalition</em> and <em>number of seats by party/coalition</em> in the last election (in bicameral legislatures, upper house results are listed first). In general, parties with less than four seats and less than 4 percent of the vote are aggregated and listed as "other," and non-party-affiliated seats are listed as "independent." Also, the entries for some countries include two sets of <em>percent of vote by party</em> and <em>seats by party</em>; the former reflects results following a formal election announcement, and the latter – following a mid-term or byelection – reflects changes in a legislature’s political party composition.<br><br>
Of the approximately 240 countries with legislative bodies, approximately two-thirds are unicameral, and the remainder, bicameral. The selection of legislative members is typically governed by a country's constitution and/or its electoral laws. In general, members are either directly elected by a country's eligible voters using a defined electoral system; indirectly elected or selected by its province, state, or department legislatures; or appointed by the country's executive body. Legislative members in many countries are selected both directly and indirectly, and the electoral laws of some countries reserve seats for women and various ethnic and minority groups.<br><br> 
Worldwide, the two predominant direct voting systems are plurality/majority and proportional representation. The most common of the several plurality/majority systems is simple majority vote, or first-past-the-post, in which the candidate receiving the most votes is elected. Countries' legislatures such as Bangladesh's Parliament, Malaysia's House of Representatives, and the United Kingdom's House of Commons use this system. Another common plurality/majority system – absolute majority or two-round – requires that candidates win at least 50 percent of the votes to be elected. If none of the candidates meets that vote threshold in the initial election, a second poll or"runoff" is held soon after for the two top vote getters, and the candidate receiving a simple vote majority is declared the winner. Examples of the two-round system are Haiti's Chamber of Deputies, Mali's National Assembly, and Uzbekistan's Legislative Chamber. Other plurality/majority voting systems, referred to as preferential voting and generally used in multi-seat constituencies, are block vote and single non-transferable vote, in which voters cast their ballots by ranking their candidate preferences from highest to lowest.<br><br>
Proportional representation electoral systems – in contrast to plurality/majority systems – generally award legislative seats to political parties in approximate proportion to the number of votes each receives. For example, in a 100-member legislature, if Party A receives 50 percent of the total vote, Party B, 30 percent, and Party C, 20 percent, then Party A would be awarded 50 seats, Party B 30 seats, and Party C 20 seats. There are various forms of proportional representation and the degree of reaching proportionality varies. Some forms of proportional representation are focused solely on achieving the proportional representation of different political parties and voters cast ballots only for political parties, whereas in other forms, voters cast ballots for individual candidates within a political party.<br><br>
Many countries - both unicameral and bicameral - use a mix of electoral methods, in which a portion of legislative seats are awarded using one system, such as plurality/majority, while the remaining seats are awarded by another system, such as proportional representation. Many countries with bicameral legislatures use different voting systems for the two chambers.

**Judicial branch (#314)**<br>
This entry includes three subfields. The <em>highest court(s)</em> subfield includes the name(s) of a country's highest level court(s), the number and titles of the judges, and the types of cases heard by the court, which commonly are based on civil, criminal, administrative, and constitutional law. A number of countries have separate constitutional courts. The <em>judge selection and term of office</em> subfield includes the organizations and associated officials responsible for nominating and appointing judges, and a brief description of the process. The selection process can be indicative of the independence of a country's court system from other branches of its government. Also included in this subfield are judges' tenures, which can range from a few years, to a specified retirement age, to lifelong appointments. The <em>subordinate courts</em> subfield lists the courts lower in the hierarchy of a country's court system. A few countries with federal-style governments, such as Brazil, Canada, and the US, in addition to their federal court, have separate state- or province-level court systems, though generally the two systems interact.

**Political parties and leaders (#315)**<br>
This entry includes a listing of significant political parties, coalitions, and electoral lists as of each country's last legislative election, unless otherwise noted.

**International organization participation (#317)**<br>
This entry lists in alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations in which the subject country is a member or participates in some other way.

**Diplomatic representation in the US (#318)**<br>
This entry includes the <em>chief of mission</em>, <em>chancery address</em>, <em>telephone</em>, <em>FAX</em>, <em>consulate general</em> locations, and <em>consulate</em> locations. The use of the annotated title Appointed Ambassador refers to a new ambassador who has presented his/her credentials to the secretary of state but not the US president. Such ambassadors fulfill all diplomatic functions except meeting with or appearing at functions attended by the president until such time as they formally present their credentials at a White House ceremony.

**Diplomatic representation from the US (#319)**<br>
This entry includes the <em>chief of mission</em>, <em>embassy</em> address, <em>mailing address</em>, <em>telephone</em> number, <em>FAX</em> number, <em>branch office</em> locations, <em>consulate general</em> locations, and <em>consulate</em> locations.

**Flag description (#320)**<br>
This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual flags or the best information available at the time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.

**National symbol(s) (#321)**<br>
A national symbol is a faunal, floral, or other abstract representation - or some distinctive object - that over time has come to be closely identified with a country or entity. Not all countries have national symbols; a few countries have more than one.

**National anthem (#322)**<br>
A generally patriotic musical composition - usually in the form of a song or hymn of praise - that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions, or struggles of a nation or its people. National anthems can be officially recognized as a national song by a country's constitution or by an enacted law, or simply by tradition. Although most anthems contain lyrics, some do not.

**Government - note (#323)**<br>
This entry includes miscellaneous government information of significance not included elsewhere.

## Economy

**Economic overview (#207)**<br>
This entry briefly describes five economic components for a given country:<br /><br />* <em><strong>National Economy</strong></em>, including a brief economic history;<br /><br />* <em><strong>Domestic Markets</strong></em>, including labor and wage markets as well as brief commentary on economic sector portfolios;<br /><br />* <em><strong>Financial Power and Public Finance</strong></em>, including brief discussions of financial market strengths and security, lending/exchange rates (especially if abnormalities exist), and foreign direct investments;<br /><br />* <em><strong>Trade Power and Influence</strong></em>, including brief commentary on chief imports and exports; and <br /><br />* <em><strong>Regional Strategy and Efforts</strong></em>, including key partners, regional economic development efforts, and any underlying economic data integrity concerns.

**Real GDP (purchasing power parity) (#208)**<br>
This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United States in the year noted. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The differences between the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries are generally much smaller.

**GDP (official exchange rate) (#209)**<br>
This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at official exchange rates (OER) is the home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the bilateral average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-à-vis its neighbors, judging that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however, can be artificially fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting in claims of the country having an under- or over-valued currency - and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate. Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is market-determined, market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services (the ones the country trades) and may not capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces. Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic GDP over time, since appreciation/depreciation from one year to the next will make the OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated GDP changed.

**Real GDP growth rate (#210)**<br>
This entry gives a country's real GDP annual growth rate, adjusted for seasonal unemployment and inflation. A country's growth rate is year-over-year, and not compounded.

**Real GDP per capita (#211)**<br>
This entry shows real GDP, divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.

**Gross national saving (#212)**<br>
Gross national saving is derived by deducting final consumption expenditure (household plus government) from Gross national disposable income, and consists of personal saving, plus business saving (the sum of the capital consumption allowance and retained business profits), plus government saving (the excess of tax revenues over expenditures), but excludes foreign saving (the excess of imports of goods and services over exports). The figures are presented as a percent of GDP. A negative number indicates that the economy as a whole is spending more income than it produces, thus drawing down national wealth (dissaving).

**GDP - composition, by end use (#213)**<br>
This entry shows who does the spending in an economy: consumers, businesses, government, and foreigners. The distribution gives the percentage contribution to total GDP of <em>household consumption, government consumption, investment in fixed capital, investment in inventories, exports of goods and services, and imports of goods and services</em>, and will total 100 percent of GDP if the data are complete.<br /> <br /><em>household consumption</em> consists of expenditures by resident households, and by nonprofit institutions that serve households, on goods and services that are consumed by individuals. This includes consumption of both domestically produced and foreign goods and services. <br /><br /><em>government consumption</em> consists of government expenditures on goods and services. These figures exclude government transfer payments, such as interest on debt, unemployment, and social security, since such payments are not made in exchange for goods and services supplied. <br /><br /><em>investment in fixed capital</em> consists of total business spending on fixed assets, such as factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings, and inventories of raw materials, which provide the basis for future production. It is measured gross of the depreciation of the assets, i.e., it includes investment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped capital. Earlier editions of <em>The World Factbook</em> referred to this concept as Investment (gross fixed) and that data now have been moved to this new field.<br /><br /><em>investment in inventories</em> consists of net changes to the stock of outputs that are still held by the units that produce them, awaiting further sale to an end user, such as automobiles sitting on a dealer&rsquo;s lot or groceries on the store shelves. This figure may be positive or negative. If the stock of unsold output increases during the relevant time period, <em>investment in inventories</em> is positive, but, if the stock of unsold goods declines, it will be negative. <em>Investment in inventories</em> normally is an early indicator of the state of the economy. If the stock of unsold items increases unexpectedly &ndash; because people stop buying - the economy may be entering a recession; but if the stock of unsold items falls - and goods "go flying off the shelves" - businesses normally try to replace those stocks, and the economy is likely to accelerate.<br /><br /><em>exports of goods and services</em> consist of sales, barter, gifts, or grants of goods and services from residents to nonresidents.<br /><br /><em>imports of goods and services</em> consist of purchases, barter, or receipts of gifts, or grants of goods and services by residents from nonresidents. <em>Exports</em> are treated as a positive item, while imports are treated as a negative item. In a purely accounting sense, <em>imports</em> have no direct impact on GDP, which only measures output of the domestic economy. Imports are entered as a negative item to offset the fact that the expenditure figures for consumption, investment, government, and exports also include expenditures on imports. These imports contribute directly to foreign GDP but only indirectly to domestic GDP. Because of this negative offset for imports of goods and services, the sum of the other five items, excluding imports, will always total more than 100 percent of GDP. A surplus of exports of goods and services over imports indicates an economy is investing abroad, while a deficit indicates an economy is borrowing from abroad.

**GDP - composition, by sector of origin (#214)**<br>
This entry shows where production takes place in an economy. The distribution gives the percentage contribution of <em>agriculture, industry</em>, and <em>services</em> to total GDP, and will total 100 percent of GDP if the data are complete. Agriculture includes farming, fishing, and forestry. Industry includes mining, manufacturing, energy production, and construction. Services cover government activities, communications, transportation, finance, and all other private economic activities that do not produce material goods.

**Agricultural products (#215)**<br>
This entry provides a country's ten most important agricultural products, listed by annual tonnage.

**Industries (#216)**<br>
This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting with the largest by value of annual output.

**Industrial production growth rate (#217)**<br>
This entry gives the annual percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).

**Labor force (#218)**<br>
This entry contains the total labor force figure.

**Labor force - by occupation (#219)**<br>
This entry lists the percentage distribution of the labor force by sector of occupation. <em>Agriculture</em> includes farming, fishing, and forestry. <em>Industry</em> includes mining, manufacturing, energy production, and construction. <em>Services</em> cover government activities, communications, transportation, finance, and all other economic activities that do not produce material goods. The distribution will total less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete and may range from 99-101 percent due to rounding.

**Unemployment rate (#220)**<br>
This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.

**Population below poverty line (#221)**<br>
National estimates of the percentage of the population falling below the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.

**Household income or consumption by percentage share (#222)**<br>
Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys, the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.

**Gini Index coefficient - distribution of family income (#223)**<br>
This entry measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index of 25. The more unequal a country's income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of 50. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.

**Budget (#224)**<br>
This entry includes <em>revenues</em>, <em>expenditures</em>, and capital expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

**Taxes and other revenues (#225)**<br>
This entry records total taxes and other revenues received by the national government during the time period indicated, expressed as a percent of GDP. Taxes include personal and corporate income taxes, value added taxes, excise taxes, and tariffs. Other revenues include social contributions - such as payments for social security and hospital insurance - grants, and net revenues from public enterprises. Normalizing the data, by dividing total revenues by GDP, enables easy comparisons across countries, and provides an average rate at which all income (GDP) is paid to the national level government for the supply of public goods and services.

**Budget surplus (+) or deficit (-) (#226)**<br>
This entry records the difference between national government revenues and expenditures, expressed as a percent of GDP. A positive (+) number indicates that revenues exceeded expenditures (a budget surplus), while a negative (-) number indicates the reverse (a budget deficit). Normalizing the data, by dividing the budget balance by GDP, enables easy comparisons across countries and indicates whether a national government saves or borrows money. Countries with high budget deficits (relative to their GDPs) generally have more difficulty raising funds to finance expenditures, than those with lower deficits.

**Public debt (#227)**<br>
This entry records the cumulative total of all government borrowings less repayments that are denominated in a country's home currency. Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and public sector and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.

**Fiscal year (#228)**<br>
This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for a country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar year but which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).

**Inflation rate (consumer prices) (#229)**<br>
This entry provides the annual inflation rate, as calculated by the percent change in current consumer prices from the previous year's consumer prices.

**Credit ratings (#237)**<br>
This entry provides the current bond ratings for a country or territory from each of the three major credit bureaus (Fitch, Moody&rsquo;s, and Standard &amp; Poors). These ratings allow investors, including international finance institutions (e.g., the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, etc.) to understand how likely a government&rsquo;s bond is to default. Rating factors include the following aspects: current account balance, debt payment history and timeliness, banking and financial operations, future economic outlook, and national economic strength. While in recent years other credit rating agencies have proliferated, these three credit agencies constitute more than 95% of the credit evaluation market globally and are the primary sovereign debt ratings considered by international and regional finance institutions.

**Current account balance (#238)**<br>
This entry records a country's net trade in goods and services, plus net earnings from rents, interest, profits, and dividends, and net transfer payments (such as pension funds and worker remittances) to and from the rest of the world during the period specified. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

**Exports (#239)**<br>
This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise exports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

**Exports - commodities (#240)**<br>
This entry provides a listing of the highest-valued exported products; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

**Exports - partners (#241)**<br>
This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

**Imports (#242)**<br>
This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise imports on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

**Imports - commodities (#243)**<br>
This entry provides a listing of the highest-valued imported products; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

**Reserves of foreign exchange and gold (#245)**<br>
This entry gives the dollar value for the stock of all financial assets that are available to the central monetary authority for use in meeting a country's balance of payments needs as of the end-date of the period specified. This category includes not only foreign currency and gold, but also a country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the International Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.

**Debt - external (#246)**<br>
This entry gives the total public and private debt owed to nonresidents repayable in internationally accepted currencies, goods, or services. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

**Exchange rates (#249)**<br>
This entry provides the average annual price of a country's monetary unit for the time period specified, expressed in units of local currency per US dollar, as determined by international market forces or by official fiat. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for the national medium of exchange is presented in parenthesis. Closing daily exchange rates are not presented in <em>The World Factbook</em>, but are used to convert stock values - e.g., the market value of publicly traded shares - to US dollars as of the specified date.

**Imports - partners (#403)**<br>
This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.

**Ease of Doing Business Index scores (#405)**<br>
<p style="text-align: left;">The World Bank Group <em>Doing Business</em> project measures business regulations and enforcement mechanisms across economies. The project evaluates domestic small- and medium-size companies and measures the regulations applying to them through their life cycle. The project encourages economies to compete towards more efficient regulation; offers measurable benchmarks for reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers, and others interested in the business climate of each economy. The scores range from 0-100m with higher scores indicating better business environments.<br /><br /></p>
<p>The first number listed is a country&rsquo;s overall score across all ten indicators of the index. The second number listed refers to the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;Starting a Business&rdquo; score, capturing the ease of successful entrepreneurship. The third number listed is the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trading&rdquo; score that shows how easy it is for businesses to engage in international trade. The final number listed is the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;Enforcement&rdquo; score that refers to how well business agreement enforcement exists in courts and other adjudication bodies.</p>

## Energy

**Electricity access (#251)**<br>
This entry provides information on access to electricity.

**Telecommunication systems (#198)**<br>
This entry includes a brief general assessment of a country's telecommunications system with details on the domestic and international components. The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry: <br />
<p><strong>2G -</strong>&nbsp;is short for second-generation&nbsp;cellular network. After 2G was launched, the previous mobile wireless network systems were retroactively dubbed&nbsp;1G. While radio signals on 1G networks are&nbsp;analog, radio signals on 2G networks are&nbsp;digital. Both systems use digital signaling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the devices) to the rest of the mobile system.<br /><strong>3G -&nbsp;</strong>is the third generation of&nbsp;wireless&nbsp;mobile telecommunications technology. It is the upgrade for&nbsp;2.5G&nbsp;and&nbsp;2.5G&nbsp;GPRS&nbsp;networks, for faster data transfer. &nbsp;This increased speed is based on a set of standards used for mobile devices and mobile telecommunications use services and networks that comply with the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specifications by the&nbsp;International Telecommunication Union. 3G finds application in wireless voice telephony,&nbsp;mobile Internet&nbsp;access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls, and mobile TV.<br /><strong>4G -</strong>&nbsp;is the fourth generation of&nbsp;broadband&nbsp;cellular network&nbsp;technology, succeeding&nbsp;3G. The first-release&nbsp;Long Term Evolution&nbsp;(LTE) standard was commercially deployed in&nbsp;Oslo, Norway, and&nbsp;Stockholm, Sweden&nbsp;in 2009, and has since been deployed throughout most parts of the world. Applications, include enhanced mobile web access, IP telephony, high-definition mobile TV, and video conferencing.<br /><strong>5G -</strong>&nbsp;is the fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks, which&nbsp;cellular phone companies&nbsp;began deploying worldwide in 2019; it is the planned successor to the&nbsp;4G&nbsp;networks which provide connectivity to most current&nbsp;cellphones.&nbsp;Like its predecessors, 5G networks are&nbsp;cellular networks, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called&nbsp;cells. All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;and&nbsp;telephone network&nbsp;by&nbsp;radio waves&nbsp;through a local&nbsp;antenna&nbsp;in the cell. The main advantage of the new networks is that they will have greater bandwidth, allowing higher download speeds, eventually up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbit/s). Due to the increased bandwidth, the expectation is that the new networks will not just serve cellphones like existing cellular networks, but also be used as general Internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as&nbsp;cable Internet. Existing 4G cellphones will not be able to use the new networks, which will require new 5G-enabled wireless devices.<br /><strong>ADSL -</strong> Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) that allows faster data transmission via copper service phone lines to a home or business. ADSL provides an &ldquo;always on&rdquo; connection and higher speeds than dial-up Internet can provide. In ADSL, bandwidth and bit rate (i.e., speed) are asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer (downstream) than the reverse (upstream).<br /><strong>AngoSat 2</strong> - geostationary communications satellite for ground communication and broadcasting infrastructure in Angola, operated by Angosat and built by the Russian company ISS Reshetnev.<br /><strong>Arabsat</strong> - Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). <br /><strong>Cellular telephone system</strong> - the telephones in this system are radio transceivers, with each instrument having its own private radio frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the booster station in its area (cell), from which the telephone signal is fed to a telephone exchange. <br /><strong>Central American Microwave System</strong> - a trunk microwave radio relay system that links the countries of Central America and Mexico with each other. <br /><strong>Coaxial cable</strong> - a multichannel communication cable consisting of a central conducting wire, surrounded by and insulated from a cylindrical conducting shell; a large number of telephone channels can be made available within the insulated space by the use of a large number of carrier frequencies. <br /><strong>DSL - </strong>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines.<br /><strong>e-services</strong> - Electronic services rely on information and communication technologies (ICT); the three main components of e-services are the service provider, service receiver (or customer), and the channel for delivery, generally the Internet. E-services have expanded to e-health, e-commerce, e-fleet, and e-government, among other services. E-services are also linked to the development of IoT and smart city technology.<br /><strong>ECOWAS</strong> telecommunications - Economic Community of West African States regional telecommunications development program, focused on broadband infrastructure, landing of submarine cables, and the establishment of a single liberalized telecoms market.<br /><strong>Eutelsat</strong> - European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Paris). <br /><strong>Fiber-optic cable</strong> - a multichannel communications cable using a thread of optical glass fibers as a transmission medium in which the signal (voice, video, etc.) is in the form of a coded pulse of light.<br /><strong>FTTX</strong> - Fiber to the x (FTTX) is a generic term for any&nbsp;broadband&nbsp;network architecture using&nbsp;optical fiber&nbsp;to provide all or part of the&nbsp;local loop&nbsp;used for&nbsp;last mile&nbsp;telecommunications. As fiber optic cables are able to carry much more data than copper cables, especially over long distances, copper telephone networks built in the 20th century are being replaced by fiber. FTTX is a general term for several configurations of fiber deployment, broadly organized into two groups: FTTN and FTTP /H/B. Fiber to the node (FTTN), also referred to as Fiber to the neighborhood, delivers fiber to within 300m (1,000 ft) of a customer&rsquo;s premises. Fiber to the premises (FTTP) can be further categorized as fiber to the home (FTTH) or fiber to the building/business (FTTB). FTTN (and FTTC, fiber to the curb (to less than 300m (1,000 ft of a customer&rsquo;s premises)) are seen as interim steps toward full FTTP.<br /><strong>Galileo</strong> - Chartered in 2016, Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) created by the European Union through the European Space Agency (ESA), and operated by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).

As opposed to a standard copper wire in most networks, GPONs are 95% more energy efficient.<br /><strong>GSM</strong> - a global system for mobile (cellular) communications devised by the Groupe Special Mobile of the pan-European standardization organization, Conference Europeanne des Posts et Telecommunications (CEPT) in 1982. <br /><strong>HF</strong> - high frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to 30,000-kHz range. <br /><strong>HSPA </strong>- High Speed Packet Access&nbsp;(HSPA) is an amalgamation of two&nbsp;mobile&nbsp;protocols, High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) and High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), that extends and improves the performance of existing&nbsp;3G&nbsp;mobile telecommunication networks using the&nbsp;WCDMA&nbsp;protocols. A further improved&nbsp;3GPP&nbsp;standard,&nbsp;Evolved High Speed Packet Access&nbsp;(also known as HSPA+), was released late in 2008 with subsequent worldwide adoption beginning in 2010. The newer standard allows bit-rates to reach as high as 337&nbsp;Mbit/s in the downlink and 34&nbsp;Mbit/s in the uplink. However, these speeds are rarely achieved in practice.<br /><strong>ICT </strong>-&nbsp; Information and communications technology (ICT) encompasses the capture, storage, retrieval, processing, display, representation, presentation, organization, management, security, transfer, and interchange of data and information; includes all categories of ubiquitous technology used for the gathering, storing, transmitting, retrieving, or processing of information.<br /><strong>Inmarsat</strong> - International Maritime Satellite Organization; a British&nbsp;satellite telecommunications&nbsp;company, offering global mobile services.

For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the following five groups - (1)<em> over 3,047 m</em> (over 10,000 ft), (2) <em>2,438 to 3,047 m</em> (8,000 to 10,000 ft), (3) <em>1,524 to 2,437 m</em> (5,000 to 8,000 ft), (4) <em>914 to 1,523 m</em> (3,000 to 5,000 ft), and (5)<em> under 914 m</em> (under 3,000 ft). Only airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control. The type aircraft capable of operating from a runway of a given length is dependent upon a number of factors including elevation of the runway, runway gradient, average maximum daily temperature at the airport, engine types, flap settings, and take-off weight of the aircraft.

**Airports - with unpaved runways (#381)**<br>
This entry gives the <em>total</em> number of airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces) by length. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the following five groups - (1)<em> over 3,047 m</em> (over 10,000 ft), (2) <em>2,438 to 3,047 m</em> (8,000 to 10,000 ft), (3) <em>1,524 to 2,437 m</em> (5,000 to 8,000 ft), (4) <em>914 to 1,523 m</em> (3,000 to 5,000 ft), and (5)<em> under 914 m</em> (under 3,000 ft). Only airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control. The type aircraft capable of operating from a runway of a given length is dependent upon a number of factors including elevation of the runway, runway gradient, average maximum daily temperature at the airport, engine types, flap settings, and take-off weight of the aircraft.

**Heliports (#382)**<br>
This entry gives the total number of heliports with hard-surface runways, helipads, or landing areas that support routine sustained helicopter operations exclusively and have support facilities including one or more of the following facilities: lighting, fuel, passenger handling, or maintenance. It includes former airports used exclusively for helicopter operations but excludes heliports limited to day operations and natural clearings that could support helicopter landings and takeoffs.

**Pipelines (#383)**<br>
This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.

**Railways (#384)**<br>
This entry states the <em>total</em> route length of the railway network and of its component parts by gauge, which is the measure of the distance between the inner sides of the load-bearing rails. The four typical types of gauges are: <em>broad</em>, <em>standard</em>, <em>narrow</em>, and <em>dual</em>. Other gauges are listed under <em>note</em>. Some 60% of the world's railways use the standard gauge of 1.4 m (4.7 ft). Gauges vary by country and sometimes within countries. The choice of gauge during initial construction was mainly in response to local conditions and the intent of the builder. Narrow-gauge railways were cheaper to build and could negotiate sharper curves, broad-gauge railways gave greater stability and permitted higher speeds. Standard-gauge railways were a compromise between narrow and broad gauges.

**Roadways (#385)**<br>
This entry gives the <em>total</em> length of the road network and includes the length of the <em>paved</em> and <em>unpaved</em> portions.

**Waterways (#386)**<br>
This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.

**Merchant marine (#387)**<br>
This entry provides the total and the number of each type of privately or publicly owned commercial ship for each country; military ships are not included; the five ships by type include: <em>bulk carrier</em> - for cargo such as coal, grain, cement, ores, and gravel; <em>container ship</em> - for loads in truck-size containers, a transportation system called containerization; <em>general cargo</em> - also referred to as break-bulk containers - for a wide variety of packaged merchandise, such as textiles, furniture and machinery; <em>oil tanker</em> - for crude oil and petroleum products; <em>other</em> - includes chemical carriers, dredgers, liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, refrigerated cargo ships called reefers, tugboats, passenger vessels (cruise and ferry), and offshore supply ships&nbsp;

**Ports and terminals (#388)**<br>
This entry lists major ports and terminals primarily on the basis of the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through the facilities on an annual basis. In some instances, the number of containers handled or ship visits were also considered. Most ports service multiple classes of vessels including bulk carriers (dry and liquid), break bulk cargoes (goods loaded individually in bags, boxes, crates, or drums; sometimes palletized), containers, roll-on/roll-off, and passenger ships. The listing leads off with <em>major seaports</em> handling all types of cargo. Inland <em>river/lake ports</em> are listed separately along with the river or lake name. Ports configured specifically to handle bulk cargoes are designated as <em>oil terminals</em> or <em>dry bulk cargo ports</em>. <em>LNG terminals</em> handle liquefied natural gas (LNG) and are differentiated as either export, where the gas is chilled to a liquid state to reduce its volume for transport on specialized gas carriers, or import, where the off-loaded LNG undergoes a regasification process before entering pipelines for distribution. As break bulk cargoes are largely transported by containers today, the entry also includes a listing of major <em>container ports</em> with the corresponding throughput measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Some ports are significant for handling passenger traffic and are listed as <em>cruise/ferry ports</em>. In addition to commercial traffic, many seaports also provide important military infrastructure such as naval bases or dockyards.

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions (#411)**<br>
This entry provides basic information on each country&rsquo;s military equipment inventories, as well as how they acquire their equipment; it is intended to show broad trends in major military equipment holdings, such as tanks and other armored vehicles, air defense systems, artillery, naval ships, helicopters, and fixed-wing aircraft. Arms acquisition information is an overview of major arms suppliers over a specific period of time, including second-hand arms delivered as aid, with a focus on major weapons systems. It is based on the type and number of weapon systems ordered and delivered and the financial value of the deal. For some countries, general information on domestic defense industry capabilities is provided.

**Military deployments (#412)**<br>
<p>This entry lists military forces deployed to other countries or territories abroad. <em>The World Factbook </em>defines deployed as a permanently-stationed force or a temporary deployment of greater than six months.&nbsp; Deployments smaller than 100 personnel or paramilitaries, police, contractors, mercenaries, or proxy forces are not included. Numbers provided are estimates only and should be considered paper strengths, not necessarily the current number of troops on the ground.&nbsp; In addition, some estimates, such as those by the US military, are significantly influenced by deployment policies, contingencies, or world events and may change suddenly. Where available, the organization or mission that at least some of the forces are deployed under is listed. The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry:&nbsp;</p>

## Transnational Issues

**Disputes - international (#326)**<br>
This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US Government.

**Refugees and internally displaced persons (#327)**<br>
This entry includes those persons residing in a country as <em>refugees</em>, <em>internally displaced persons (IDPs)</em>, or <em>stateless persons</em>. Each country's refugee entry includes only countries of origin that are the source of refugee populations of 5,000 or more. The definition of a refugee according to a UN Convention is "a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution." The UN established the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has a different operational definition for a Palestinian refugee: "a person whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict." However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not covered under the UNRWA definition. The term "internally displaced person" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it is used to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons similar to refugees, but who remain within their own national territory and are subject to the laws of that state. A <strong>stateless person</strong> is defined as someone who is not considered a national by any state under the operation of its law, according to UN convention.

**Trafficking in persons (#328)**<br>
Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection issues, estimated in 2011 that 20.9 million people worldwide were victims of forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude, and involuntary servitude. Human trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's annual <em>Trafficking in Persons Report</em>, which assesses the government response (i.e., the <em>current situation</em>) in some 150 countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the annual report are rated in three tiers, based on government efforts to combat trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are those listed in the <em>2020 Trafficking in Persons Report</em> as 'Tier 2 Watch List' or 'Tier 3' based on the following <em>tier rating</em> definitions:<br /><strong>Tier 2 Watch List</strong> countries do not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria: <br />1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims, <br />2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in persons, or, <br />3. they have committed to take action over the next year.<br /><strong>Tier 3</strong> countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to do so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential non-humanitarian and non-trade sanctions.

**Illicit drugs (#329)**<br>
